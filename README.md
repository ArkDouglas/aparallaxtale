## Overview

_A Parallax Tale_ is a **work-in-progress** story that will be brought to life using pure HTML and CSS, without the use of any frameworks or libraries. This project showcases the power of CSS in creating engaging parallax effects and smooth animations to narrate a captivating journey.

In this tale, the protagonist starts in his bed, wakes up, moves out of his house, walks to a cliff, and looks over it to see a distant village. He begins climbing down and meets various characters—a goose, a giant furry monster, a snake, and more. An unexpected event traps him at the bottom, but the friends he made along the way assist him in climbing back up, leading to a heartfelt conclusion.

## Additional Scene Details

### Scene 1:

- **Details:**
  - Looking at the bad guy sleeping, maybe some Z’s popping out.
  - Zoom into the guy's head, camera rotates, guy sits up—you’re looking out of his eyes.
  - You see darkness as his hands rub off his tired eyes and move out of the way; you’re looking at the cabin.

### Scene 2:

- **Details:**
  - The door opens, you see the bright outside.
  - The camera moves in towards it as it gets closer.
  - The bright door gets bigger (sun rays casting through) and it comes into focus looking at the great outdoors.

### Scene 3:

- **Details:**
  - The camera pans left and right and looks around, forest on either side, a dusty trail ahead.
  - A dusty trail leads ahead with some clouds in the view.
  - Third person as the guy walks down the trail, clouds move around, sun moves a little.

### Scene 4:

- **Details:**
  - As you approach, clouds move away.
  - Once you reach the edge, the camera zooms into the guy's eyes and he looks out over the clouds; they move around.
  - The camera pans down and sees the cliff at the foot, village at the bottom, perhaps a character traveling on the dusty trail.
  - This could be where he meets the goose, flying up the tall cliff and telling him that it’s a very long journey and a man with legs probably couldn't make it because he doesn't have wings. Maybe he gives him a feather?

### Scene 5/6:

1. **Details:**
   - The camera zoom turns around (from the character's feet to stare at his face).
   - The guy ducks down out of view. The camera pulls out and he’s climbing down the cliff.
2. **Details:**
   - The man begins climbing down, arms, legs, etc.
   - The sun maybe continues to set and cast a shadow.
   - As he climbs down, a giant figure comes out sideways (cliff on right, giant scary hand touches cliff, giant monster face black with big glowing yellow eyes comes out because sun shadow silhouette).

### Scene 7:

- **Details:**
  - The guy puts his hand over his eyes to shield the sun (to transition to the monster's face).
  - As his hand comes up, the black shadow opacity pulls back and it's a fuzzy brown monster with yellow eyes and two teeth and a big smile.
  - Dialogue of some sort. Perhaps the monster gives him fur?

### Scene 8:

- **Details:**
  - The descent continues.
  - Perhaps an encounter with a snake? A mouse might be more fitting?
  - More dialogue? A fox warning him of impending doom?
